Abusetool
=========

Abusetool is the abuse desk tool I wished that Joyent had when I was dealing with
abuse there.  This is a work in progress to start gathering data from various
sources to provide data via API calls (a seperate restify app is in development)
so that CIDR ranges can be blocked using by various chef cookbooks (i.e. Spammers
and compromised hosts can be blocked from sending SPAM or connecting to apache).

TODO
----

We now have a [TODO](TODO.md) list in a seperate file.
