The massive TODO list for abusetool to make it really awesome (and get all the
things you want to see on your screen when working an abuse ticket):

 - [ ] Track abuse by IP and link back to CIDR block
 - [ ] Link CIDR's to the ASN announcing the netblock
 - [ ] Provide a report showing IP's where abuse is originating from
 - [ ] Provide a report showing hosting providers hosting exploited hosts and
       when we notified them last of abuse
 - [ ] Write an email that gets sent to hosting companies hosting exploited hosts
 - [ ] Write an importer to import ASN details
 - [ ] Link to HE's BGP pages for more information
 - [ ] Cache WHOIS lookups
 - [ ] Parse incoming emails for WordPress dictionary attacks (rewrite in node.js)
